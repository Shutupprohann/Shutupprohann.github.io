##### Hello There!

*well i dont know how should i start this post (nervous laughter).*

So if you are reading this,i have sucessfully setup my personal website using hugo and github pages (*No claps please,lol*).

I learned quite a few things about websites while doing it.I will be posting my writeups,thoughts and other things here,
and will try to improve this website with time.

Well,That's all for now.(*I dont want to uneccessarily extend this post anymore.)*

##### Stay Tuned :)
